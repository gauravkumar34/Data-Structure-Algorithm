Exception -> 

NullPointer
ParseException
IndexOutOfBounException


What?

Java Code -> 

1. Normal Code 
int a = 10;

2. Critical Code
integers
a = from user
b = from the user

int result = a/b;

if b = 0; -> divide by zero error -> arithmeticexception

-> read from external sources(file, database)



Handling Critical code -> exception Handling

Bunch of classes -> help
Exception  

1. Checked -> resolved at compile time

2. UncheckedException -> resolved at runtime


Handling
1. try...catch...finally blocks
declare as well as handle the exception ->
2. throws -> used for checked exceptions
declare -> at the method level saying the statements in side this method are likely to throw an exception
handling will be taken care of by the class/method that calls the method
3. throw
declare -> this used to throw exception explicity
