Input Output operations -> 

Scanner -> data -> binary format -> 1's and 0's -> stream

File, Database.

Employee Application
Student Result -> reading from a file


hello
converted to ascii format - utf8
reader/writer
raw format 1's 0's


binary -> stream / reader classes

1. binary data -> 8 bytes of data -> stream input/output - byte stream -> video,audio
2. character data -> 16 bytes -> reader/writer - character stream - text ->


System.out


BufferedInputStream -> InputStream(file,string.....) -> 8kb buffer -> java source read


Stock Analyzer

cipla.csv -> comma seperated files

date,open,high,low,close -> one line of data.....1000

readLine()

class Stock{
    Date date;
    double open;
    double high;
    double low;
    double close;
}

class StockAnalyzer{
    Stock[] readFile()
    {
        read the file line by line
        lines -> size of the array
        declare
        Stock[] stocks = new Stock[n];
        read file line by line
        split each line
        split the line and put it into the object
        line[]
        Stock stock = new (line[0],line[1])....


        return 1000 records;
    }


    read the close price of record 1
    read the close price of last record

    abs return formula = 

use to calculate formula
