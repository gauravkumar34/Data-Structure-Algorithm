# Problem Statement - Temperature Converter

Write a program that prints out a table to show the temperature in degree celsius and the equivalent temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. 

Your program must compute the temperature in Fahrenheit by using an appropriate formula for converting the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.  

This table will contain 11 rows(0, 10,20,30..till 100). The temperatures would be shown as integers.
