## Problem Statement - TravelSavers ##


TravelSavers a leading company in the US, that provides complete business travel solutions to corporates and business travellers, has invested 1000 $ into the Indian market in 1998, when the exchange rate for 1 USD was equal to 40 INR. 

The shares of the company were priced at 100 INR per share. The company has run into trouble during the covid times and wants to shut its operations in India and decides to sell all of its shares. It wants to incur, as much profit on its shares while selling them, but a tax of 10% must be paid to the government on the profit amount after selling the shares. 

Note that the USD exchanges rates have increased drastically. Convert the total amount back to dollars and display the tax paid on the amount, increase in share price, total profit in INR and USD.
