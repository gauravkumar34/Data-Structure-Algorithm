# Problem Statement - Temperature Converter

Write a program that prints out the temperature in degrees Celcius and the equivalent temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. 

Your program must compute the temperature in Fahrenheit by using an appropriate formula for converting the temperature from degree Celcius to Fahrenheit.  

The program will accept the temperature in degrees Celcius from the user and display its corresponding temperature in Fahrenheit.

Once done, it should ask the user whether he wants to continue or not. The user can respond by typing 'y' or 'n'.

## Sample Input & Output

```
Enter the temperature in Degree Celsius:
0 <PASSED AS AN INPUT>
Temperature(Celsius)=0.00           Temperature(Fahrenheit)=32.00
Do you wish to continue(y/n)?
y <PASSED AS AN INPUT>
Enter the temperature in Degree Celsius:
10 <PASSED AS AN INPUT>
Temperature(Celsius)=10.00           Temperature(Fahrenheit)=50.00
Do you wish to continue(y/n)?
n <PASSED AS AN INPUT>
```
