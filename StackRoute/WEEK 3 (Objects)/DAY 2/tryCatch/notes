        bunch of classes ->help;
        
    Exception :-
        1. checked  -> resolved at complie time
        2. unChecked -> resolved at run time

    Handling  :-
        1. try...catch..finally blocks
        declear as well as handle the exception;
        2. throws (used for checked exception)
        declear -> at the method level saying the statement in side this method are likely to throw an exception
        Handling will be taken care of by the class/method thats call the method.
        3. throw 
        declear ->this is used to throw exception explicity
