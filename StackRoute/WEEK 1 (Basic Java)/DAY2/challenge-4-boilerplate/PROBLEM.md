# Problem Statement - Temperature Converter

Write a program that prints out the temperature in degrees Celsius and the equivalent temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. 

Your program must compute the temperature in Fahrenheit by using a function called `celsiusToFahrenheit()` for converting the temperature from degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit. 

The program will accept the temperature in degrees Celsius from the user and display its corresponding temperature in Fahrenheit. Once done, it should ask the user whether he wants to continue or not. The user can respond by typing 'y' or 'n'.

## Sample Output

```
Enter the temperature in Degree Celsius:
0 <PASSED AS AN INPUT>
Temperature(Celsius)=0.00           Temperature(Fahrenheit)=32.00
Do you wish to continue(y/n)?
y <PASSED AS AN INPUT>
Enter the temperature in Degree Celsius:
10 <PASSED AS AN INPUT>
Temperature(Celsius)=10.00           Temperature(Fahrenheit)=50.00
Do you wish to continue(y/n)?
n <PASSED AS AN INPUT>
```
