*The initial step in building up the game programmatically is to explore Strings and their functionality. To enable us to get familiar with Strings, the various searching and sorting techniques on them, we will write a Java program.*


The words that will be fed to the bookworm are taken from the user as input one after another

a)	Write a Java program to get the strings as input from the user and push them to an array. Find the shortest word in the list of Strings and output the same on screen.
> **Sample Input**

    Enter the number of words: 
    5
    Enter the words
    Bangalore
    Mumbai
    Kolkata
    Delhi
    Chennai
> **Sample Output**

    The shortest word is : Delhi

b)	Write a java program that gets a word from the user and checks if the word is present in the list of words already stored in the array or not.
> **Sample Input**

    Enter a word to search: 
    Delhi

> **Sample Output**

    The word is present in the list
c)	Write a Java program to sort all of the words in the list in alphabetical order and display
> **Sample Output**

    The sorted array is: 
    1.	Bangalore
    2.	Chennai
    3.	Delhi
    4.	Kolkata
    5.	Mumbai

d) Find if any of the words in the list is a palindrome or not, print their count and the words.
> **Sample Output**

    The number of palindromes in the list : 1
    Madam
