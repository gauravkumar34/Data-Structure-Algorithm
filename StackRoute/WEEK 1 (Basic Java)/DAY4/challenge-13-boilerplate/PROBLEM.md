# Problem Statement - AG School

The final exams of class IX of the AG School have concluded and the evaluation of the answer scripts is underway. The marks entry for each student must be made into an application. 

Write a Java program to enable the operations team of the school to enter marks and publish results. In this challenge, the following are the requirements:
1.	The number of students for whom marks entry needs to be done should be provided as an input from the user
2.	The Name and Roll Number of each student should be taken as input from the user and stored in an array for easy retrieval.
3.	The students of class IX have been evaluated on the following subjects:
    - Math
    - Science
    - English
    - Language
    - Social Studies

The marks in each of the subject should be taken as input from the user and stored in arrays. Please note that the marks scored can have up to two digits after the decimal point.

Based on average marks scored, each student is graded. The grading strategy is as follows:
- Average Marks >=95 -- 'A'
- Average Marks >=80 and <90 -- 'B'
- Average Marks >=70 and <80 -- 'C'
- Average Marks >=60 and <70 -- 'D'
- Average Marks >=50 and <60 -- 'E'
- Average Marks <50 -- 'F'

The application should able to:
1.	Generate the grade, store it in an array, and display the grade for each student along with their total and average marks.
2.	the list should be sorted based on the grade in ascending order. 
3.	Generate a score card for a student based on his Roll No. which should contain the following details:
    - Name
    - Roll No.
    - Subject names and marks
    - Total marks obtained
    - Grade achieved
