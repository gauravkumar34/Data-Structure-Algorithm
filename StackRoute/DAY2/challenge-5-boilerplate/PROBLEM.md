# Problem Statement - Temperature Converter

Write a program that accepts the temperature and unit of measurement(which can be either Celcius or Fahrenheit) and display the output in the required unit of measurement.

The temperature conversion should happen through two functions:
- `celsiusToFahrenheit()`
- `fahrenheitToCelsius()`

## Sample Output

```
Enter the temperature:
0 <PASSED AS AN INPUT>
Enter the source scale(celcius(c)/fahrenheit(f))?
c <PASSED AS AN INPUT>
Temperature(Celsius)=0.00           Temperature(Fahrenheit)=32.00
Do you wish to continue(y/n)?
y <PASSED AS AN INPUT>
Enter the temperature:
32 <PASSED AS AN INPUT>
Enter the source scale(celcius(c)/fahrenheit(f))?
f <PASSED AS AN INPUT>
Temperature(Celsius)=0.00           Temperature(Fahrenheit)=32.00
Do you wish to continue(y/n)?
n <PASSED AS AN INPUT>
```
