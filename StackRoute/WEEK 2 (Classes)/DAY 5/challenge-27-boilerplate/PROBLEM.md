## Problem Statement

**The Soul of India lives in its villages. According to the census of India taken recently, 68% of Indians live in villages. The government has come up with a lot of policies to increase the standard of living of the people living in villages and provide them with all facilities. Once such facility is the opening of Grahmin banks in each state of India, in rural areas to facilitate banking services to the rural folk.** 

**The IC grahmin bank is a new venture to bring in banking services to the rural folk; as a new initiative, the bank wants to provide doorstep-banking services to the rural people. The main thrust is to get on board first time customers in underserved areas and get operations started immediately. The bank solely focuses on individuals who want to open savings bank accounts that are self operated.**

**Part 2**

The details of the customer are gathered and entered into the bank system. The savings bank account will be activated with immediate effect. A customer is entitled to open only one savings bank account currently as a primary account holder.

**Step 1:** 

Write a Java program to model the savings bank account as a Java class. Identify the attributes and behaviour of the class.

**Step 2:**

1.	The customer can be categorized as a public person, a minor or a senior citizen depending on their age. This categorization helps the bank to fix the rate of interest of the savings account for each type of individuals. Change the design of your class to incorporate the same.
2.	Similarly the bank account will be active as long as transactions are made regularly, if the account is not used for more than 365 days, it becomes a dormant account and a fresh customer KYC needs to be done. Capture this feature of the bank account and model your class accordingly.

**Step 3:**

An account holder/customer can perform banking transactions at their doorstep with the help of the bank executive. The customer can take the help of the bank executive for 
- Checking the balance in the account
- Withdrawal of money and deposit as well.

Write these behaviours in the Java program.

*Note:*
- The account number must be 13 digits long
- The bank transactions menu for a customer must be active until the bank executive clicks exit
- While performing funds transfer from one account to another, if the account number is wrong the operation must immediately abort.
