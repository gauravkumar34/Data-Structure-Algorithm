The main thrust is to get on board first time customers in underserved areas and get operations started immediately. The bank solely focuses on individuals who want to open savings bank accounts that are self operated.**

**Part 1**

Note that in an actual bank scenario, when opening an account there is a lot of information that a person needs to provide to the bank before getting started. 

>**Step 1:**

Write a Java program to help the bank executive enter the details of a customer quickly into the system, to enable the account opening. Ensure that necessary checks are made while entering the customer data.
